Guide: Using XCC Mod Creator

<hr>

<font color=yellow>Requirements</font>

<p>
You will need XCC Mixer, XCC Mod Creator, Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun or Red Alert 2.<br>
You can download the XCC utilities from <a target=_top href="/show_frame.php?src=/utilities/">http://xccu.sf.net/</a>.<br>

<hr>

<font color=yellow>Description</font>

<p>
XCC Mod Creator can be used to create and distribute Mods for Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2. It's an utility to assemble a Mod. It's not an all-in-one editor. All files that are part of a Mod are inserted in a certain category. The Mod can be exported to a XCC Mod Launcher file (XMLF), which can be used by XCC Mod Launcher. Strong compression is used for XMLF.

This shouldn't be necessary and if it is, please send <a href="mailto:Olaf van der Spek <XCC@XCC.TMFWeb.NL>">me</a> an email.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>sound</td><td>The non-EVA audio in AUD (TS) or WAV (RA2) format. For RA2, those WAVs are inserted into audio.bag/idx.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>speech</td><td>The EVA audio in AUD (TS) or WAV (RA2) format.</td></tr>

Possible filenames: banner.jpeg, xhp_button.jpeg, exit_button.jpeg, update_button.jpeg, site_button.jpeg, mod_button.jpeg and manual_button.jpeg. The width of the JPEGs should be dividable by four.<br>You can also use an intro tune by inserting a short OGG as intro.ogg</td></tr>
    <tr><td>manual</td><td>The documentation of your Mod. This will be accesible via the Manual button. It will be extracted to a temporary directory. If a file with the title index (index.chm, index.exe, index.html) exists it will be executed, otherwise the directory will be opened.</td></tr>

<font color=yellow>Additinal formats</font>

<p>
Some additional file formats are supported, either for better compression or for easier editing. 24-bit JPEG files can be used instead of 24-bit PCX files. OGG files can be used instead of AUD (TS) or WAV (RA2) files. 8-bit PCX files can be used instead of SHP files for the cameo and screen (RA2) categories.

<p>
TXT files can be used for the  string table category.

<p>
OGG <a target=_top href="http://vorbis.com/">Vorbis</a> is a professional audio encoding and streaming technology. It provides better compression/quality than MP3. AUD and WAV files used by TS and RA2 at 22050 hz, 16-bit mono have a bitrate of 86 kbit/s. Stereo WAVs used by RA2 have a bitrate of 172 kbit/s. OGG files can be used with bitrates as low as 40 kbit/channel/s. This means the compression is more than twice as good.
