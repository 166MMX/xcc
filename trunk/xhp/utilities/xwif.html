<font color=yellow>Frequently asked questions</font>

<p>
<b>Help, I can't connect to WOL without MF. What should I do?</b>

<p>
Open MF and close it again. Now you should be able to connect to WOL again. If that doesn't work, delete the hosts file in your Windows directory.

<p>
<b>How do I activate MF on Windows NT/2000/XP?</b>

<p>
MF requires read/write access to the hosts file. If it can't get access, it won't be activated automatically. You should login with an admin account.

<p>
<b>MF just kicked my buddy, while the points filter was disabled. Why did it do that?</b>

<p>
There are more filters that MF uses. Players that are on the black/red list and players that have more than eight disconnect/wash games, are filtered out.

<p>
<b>Could you add extra points filters to MF?</b>

<p>
No.
