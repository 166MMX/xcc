	<font color=yellow>Black list (BL)</font>
	<p>
		This list contains players that did not play fair.
	<hr>
	<font color=yellow>White list (WL)</font>
	<p>
		This list contains players that registered on it. Because players can easily be removed from this list, they're more likely to be fair.
	<p>
		You can register on this list via MF:
		<ul>
			<li>Open MF
			<li>Edit - Manual - Login - Nick - Ok
			<li>Right-click on your nick - Lists - White List
		</ul>

	<font color=yellow>Hall of Fame (HoF)</font>
	<p>
		The hall of fame lists the ten best players and clans on each ladder.
		Players must be registed on the white list before they can enter the hall of fame.
	<hr>
	<font color=yellow>Hall of Shame (HoS)</font>
	<p>
		The hall of shame lists the players that did not play fair.
		Players must be registed on the black list before they can enter the hall of shame. ;->
	<hr>
	<font color=yellow>Community Ladder (CL)</font>
	<p>
		A new ladder for Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge player- and clan tournament games.
		Games played by players using MF will automatically be registered on this ladder (and on the official ladder of course).
