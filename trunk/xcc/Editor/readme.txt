XCC Editor Player

This is a program that lets you edit C&C missions.

An installation is not required. However, this program places/uses a key in the registry.
If you've got XCC AV Player, install this program in the same directory.
Copy conquer.mix, desert.mix, general.mix, temperat.mix and winter.mix also to the directory of XCC Editor.

I didn't test this program on machines other than my own. So there could be bugs in the program. If you've encountered such a bug or would like to give your opinion about this program, feel free to e-mail me.
